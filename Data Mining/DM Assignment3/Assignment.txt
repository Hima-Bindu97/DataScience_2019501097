2.Consider the data set shown in Table 

   Customer ID 	    Transaction ID 	     Items Bought

        1       	0001            	{a,d,e}
	1		0024			{a,b,c,e}
	2		0012			{a,b,d,e}
	2		0031			{a,c,d,e}
	3		0015			{b,c,e}
	3		0022			{b,d,e}
	4		0029			{c,d}
	4		0040			{a,b,c}
	5		0033			{a,d,e}
	5		0038			{a,b,e}

(a)Compute the support for itemsets {e}, {b,d}, and {b,d,e} by treating each transaction ID as a market basket.
	 support for itemset {e} is-->8/10  =80%
	 support for itemset {b,d} is-->2/10  =20%
	 support for itemset {b,d,e} is-->2/10  =20%
(b) Use the results in part (a) to compute the confidence for the association rules {b,d} ---> {e} and {e} ------>{b,d}. Is confidence a symmetric measure?
	 confidence for {b,d} ---> {e} is --->2/2  =100%
	 confidence for {e} -----> {b,d} is --->2/8  =25%
 No,confidence is not a symmetric measurement
(c)Repeat part (a) by treating each customer ID as a market basket. Each item should be treated as a binary variable (1 if an item appears in atleast one transaction bought by the customer, and 0 otherwise.)
	 support for itemset {e} is-->4/5  =80%
	 support for itemset {b,d} is-->5/5  =100%
	 support for itemset {b,d,e} is-->4/5  =80%
(d)Use the results in part (c) to compute the confidence for the association rules {b,d} ---> {e} and {e}----->{b,d,}.
	 confidence for {b,d} ---> {e} is --->4/5  =80%
	 confidence for {e} -----> {b,d} is --->4/4  =100%


3.Consider the market basket transactions shown in Table

Transaction ID 		Items Bought

       1		{Milk, Beer, Diapers]
       2		{Bread, Butter, Milk}
       3		{Milk, Diapers, Cookies}
       4		{Bread, Butter, Cookies}
       5		{Beer, Cookies, Diapers}
       6                {Milk, Diapers, Bread, Butter}
       7                {Bread, Butter, Diapers}
       8                {Beer, Diapers}
       9                {Milk, Diapers, Bread, Butter}
       10		{Beer, Cookies}


(d) Find an itemset (of size 2 or larger) that has the largest support.
	{ Bread, Butter }
(e) Find a pair of items, a and b, such that the rules {a}-->{b} and {b}--->{a} have the same confidence
	{ Bread, Butter }


4) Using the data at www.stats202.com/more_stats202_logs.txt and treating each row as a "market basket" compute the support and confidence for the rule ip=65.57.245.11 â†’ "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3".

State what the support and confidence values mean in plain English in this context.
